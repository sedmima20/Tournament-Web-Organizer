# Tournament Web-Organizer

Work in progress - the official frontend will be completed and launched on GitHub Pages later. Until then, feel free to use the system and create your own frontend, but you have to follow the rules written in the [documentation](https://github.com/sedmima20/Tournament-Web-Organizer/wiki/Dokumentace-k-ve%C5%99ejn%C3%A9mu-API-turnajov%C3%A9ho-softwaru-Tournament-Web-Organizer) (ChatGPT translation recommended).

Thank you for your patience and interest in my tournament software :)
